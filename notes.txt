1. I din't uplode the data.json, I used the json file to get the data.
2. I used the questrating for the star-rating and the property type select. I thought it better as the star-rating range was 0-5.
3. I also used the ratings(no, text) for the guestrating select because because of the 0-10 range.
4. Lastly the user can see the results only when the search button is clicked.
